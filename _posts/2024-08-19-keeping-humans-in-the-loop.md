A wise man recently suggested that I write a frequent update on the startup journey to folks who might be interested.

My hope is that it's interesting, and that folks use it to reach out with feedback and ideas! They wont be this long moving forward… They better not be.

I added you if I thought you asked to be kept in the loop, but if not, smash that "unsubscribe" button or just filter me out of your inbox.

**Background**

I got obsessed about "voice bots for older people", built a prototype, quit my job, and then worked on this for 2 weeks before going on a planned family vacation. Now I'm back!

Learning: No better way to win a race than to start and then immediately stop to catch your breath. 🙄

**Premise**

With a caregiver shortage, surely there's some way that AI can augment current efforts. Currently looking at loneliness as the primary problem-to-solve. As a hook, the first prototype records the user's life story for their family, but the intention is that it's therapeutic in the process.

**Weeks so far: User need discovery!**

As many of you know, most product ideas are flawed and it's important to figure out why. So I'm engaging in user research to figure out what's wrong about it and how to fix it. In this short period, I interviewed: 11 caregivers, 4 senior citizens living alone, 3 industry experts and 1 senior living center director. 2 people got their parent to try it!

Learning: The big "duh" take-home is that there is a lot of trepidation around having people talk to a robot. The experience is pretty engaging once people try, but in it's current form, it's not serving a dire need and people are not excited yet to want to get past the initial hurdle.

I think AI companionship is like online dating in that it will become a normal part of life, but is initially met with understandable stigma. In addition to testing moves away from companionship, I'm wondering what messaging/framing, if any, would help get people over that gut reaction.

**This week:**

* Senior center/ senior living outreach to set up interviews.

* Also reaching out to learn from people who worked at similar startups in the past: companion bots, "biography", and senior support.

* Based on feedback, I'm building the ability to schedule calls. Shoutout to Rowan for helping with that.

* Lastly, I'm starting to look at things like accelerators or other programs that might..umm…accelerate things.

👋 That's it for now! Thanks!
