# Outreach continues!

**Bad news**

I’m not going to share an update next week. I have some exciting knee surgery this Friday, and I’ll likely be out of it through Monday.  Video streaming recommendations are welcome.

**Good news**

I’m in the early stages of planning a single-site pilot with a large manager of senior residences. I have a meeting this week to talk to the site director about logistics and goals. My hope is that the pilot will provide me with lots of great information about what is valued, what the blockers are, etc.

**In the news**

Computing interfaces that constantly change are challenging for folks, particularly older folks. Voice holds the promise of being the perfect intermediary layer for seniors. However, acting as a computing assistant, to-date, has meant adding each service via limited APIs: “Alexa, play Phil Lesh on Spotify (sob)”.

Anthropic, the Pepsi to OpenAI’s Coke, just announced “[Computer Use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use)”, which allows the AI to read a computer’s screen and act as a user’s personal agent on it (scroll, click, type, etc).

Developments in this space will unlock a much more compelling assistant for seniors.

**Last week**

The theme last week was outreach, particularly around user research. I didn’t hit my goal of 10 interviews scheduled, but I did get a few leads + the first bullet below, which looks very promising.

- **Interviews**

  - Applied for and set up a call for this week with the [Leap](https://www.cabhi.com/leap/) program out of CABHI, which pairs tech providers with seniors to co-create solutions.
  - Posted a recruitment message on FB to 95% of my connections. The social stress to interview ratio was not worth it 😉
  - Signed up with a firm that will folks for surveys that meet your criteria…I think I will pause on this until after seeing how far the Leap/Pilot go.

- A lot of co-founder searching, including 1 great brainstorm with Christina who helped me see my messaging through a different lens and made great suggestions. Everyone I have met has been great, but I haven’t yet matched with that special someone. The win rate on co-founder ‘dating’ is universally pretty low, so I’m not sweating it too much. I found this article which I’ve found useful: [Cofounder Mode - A Tactical Guide to Finding a Cofounder](https://repromptai.com/blog/cofounder-mode-tactical-guide-finding-cofounder).  I plan on doing regular light outreach for this moving forward.
- I noticed and appreciated that companies like [bland.ai](http://bland.ai) have the demo call very prominently on their homepage.  So I added a demo call to SageVoice.pro’s [homepage](https://www.sagevoice.pro/)

**This week**

Focusing on outreach was effective last week.  I’m going to do it again.  Once this pilot get’s defined more, I suspect I’ll take a break to adjust the product to pilot needs.

- Visit local centers where seniors hang out to put up user interview flyers
- Meeting around the pilot!
- Cofounder outreach
- 1 VC meeting, 1 VC-hosted healthcare networking event
- Tweak the messaging on the website to be more value-oriented.
- Get cut open and stitched by a surgeon
- A treat if I do my outreach homework: Experiment with the new GPT4o voice API

**As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!**
