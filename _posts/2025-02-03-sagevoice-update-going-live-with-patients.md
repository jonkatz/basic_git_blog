# We’re going live with patients!

## Exciting progress

A few weeks ago, I started talking with a cardiologist at Columbia (Thanks to Pallav for the intro 🙏!!).  I demoed it for him and he said things like “Jon, this is the future!” and “This will help people so much”.  So he asked me to convert one of his clinic’s interviews into an AI interview.

Last Thursday I demoed it for him and his team, including the people who do the interviews now. I really didn’t know which way this was going to go. They were really, really positive! **They want to start testing it with patients (subjects) next week.** I think in academic time, that means a month(?), but still!

## Voice AI is exploding…

A16z is overly optimistic about technology, most recently in crypto, but I think this write-up is pretty solid and shows just how big of a tidal shift that voice + AI is.

Is it good to be part of such a ballooning industry? Is it a bubble, a winner-take-all-market, or am I on the right side of history. I’m pretty confident that this is a shift in how much technology does for us and how it does it and there is room for a lot of niche players (at least for a while). But only the magic eight ball knows…

## Goals for February

My number one goal is and has been to find an easily identifiable customer, with a prioritized problem that I am well positioned to solve. I have some leads and my goal in February is to get further with my validation.

I have a couple of use cases I am still feeling out. They’re at different stages.

### Medical facilities (20% of my energy)

**Stage 1: Validated a painful problem**

I have heard this is an expensive problem, but not sure if people will pay for it or that I have the right solution

- It is clear that there is a pain point around medical adherence following patient discharge, particularly by ACOs (who get paid a lump fee for each patient and each re-admittance is money out of their pocket) and Skilled Nursing Facilities (who get reimbursement penalties for readmittance)
- The big risk is that I don’t have a channel for reaching them (founder/market fit) or there isn’t enough system incentive to solve this problem.

**Current activity:** I am trying to find someone who will talk to me from one of these places.

**Goal:** get 3-4 conversations with folks this month.  I have a couple warm intros I am banking on, but will also do some outreach.

### Clinical research (80% of my energy)

**Stage 2: Validated there is a problem, people are willing to pay for it (or so they say with great enthusiasm).**

- I have validated that these are problems that cost a great deal of money, I can find the people who care, and we are testing if my solution can solve them.
- The pain points identified so far are around subject screening, survey delivery and interviews.
- The big risk is that subjects wont talk to the AI or the IRB (ethics committee for research) creates a lot of friction.

**Current activity:** getting pilots off the ground to validate that it works

**Goal:** Get feedback from 4 different (interested) research groups. Have live subjects using this by the end of the month, have HIPAA compliance by the end of the month, which is a big barrier to scale.

### Hipaa compliance

- My number two goal is around getting either HIPAA Compliant or convincingly close enough to make progress.  Nobody can run any sizeable pilots with me until we have that.
- The bulk of this is moving all of my stack to Amazon, which has HIPAA compliance more or less baked into it.
- The part I was most worried about was the AI itself. On Friday, however, the foundational AI I use signed a BAA for me. A BAA basically means that my usage of them is now HIPAA compliant. 😅
- There aren’t any real barriers now except time.

## Huge thanks to Aaron for his QA work!

- Aaron actually clicks my links and uses things and they don’t work.
- Things should be buggy at this stage (otherwise it’s overbuilt), but it’s way better for Aaron to find them then have that be a first impression for someone.

## Last week

- **Demoed for a geriatric psychiatrist:**  Maybe something will come of it, probably not.

  - He was very upfront that he had no studies of his own, but is his lab group's “tech guy” and would share this with his PI (Principal Investigator-head of a lab).
  - He was encouraging, and also said “_well, this actually works, I didn’t realize AI would be here so soon_”.  He said it would be useful for “blind studies” in which they don’t want to be able to ID the subject. But he did not say “_I need this now_”.
  - I was like, “*can we set up some time for two weeks from now after you’ve had a chance to talk with your P*I” and he was like “._...No_”.

- **Cardiac demo and presentation:** As mentioned above, demoed for the cardiac clinic.  I ended up fixing some things and putting together a preso, which I used with the psychiatrist.
- **New demo:** Wrote up a food worker survey for my sister in law that is more of an open-ended interview.  She didn’t ask me to, but I’m curious to hear what she thinks.

  - Going from 1 AI agent to 2, took some energy.
  - Going from 2 to 3 was even easier.  Now I have a system!

- **Outreach fails:** I got 0 responses from my cold emails and follow ups last week. I think next time, I’ll share my outreach emails and get your feedback.
- **HIPAA research** and progress.

## This week:

- **I’m my target user:** I turn 44 on Thursday. I know a lot of folks in their 70s and 80s who are like “_my age is high, but I don’t feel old_”. Well, I disappointingly feel really fucking old. My joints hurt, a cold lasts weeks, and my skin is suddenly dry and thin.  And I complain about my ailments over email. Such a grumpy old man!

  - One way I’m _not_ aging is that I saw this study while looking for leads and think it’s hilarious: [Smart Underwear to Measure Diet-Induced Hydrogen Sulfide Production](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06802276?term=diabetes#participation-criteria)

- **Prep cardiac survey to go live:** This is about making changes to the prompts, based on feedback, testing them, and putting things in place so that I’m less likely to break things while coding, etc.
- **Outreach:** 12 new outreach emails, 12 follow ups.  Some significantly promising leads via Zeph 🙏
- **HIPAA:** where there is time, I want to inch towards this. I spent time this weekend, trying to move some stuff to AWS and it was annoying.
