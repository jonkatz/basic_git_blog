# New Pilot + Is This Viable?

Hey!

Hope you had a great weekend and are feeling productive and happy.

## Reminder: SageVoice value proposition

**We solve** interviewing subjects at scale, **for** clinical researchers, **by** offering structured interviews **using** AI-enabled telephone calls.

## New Pilot

Last Monday I had a great demo with a lab doing a 400 person study involving a behavioral intervention.  They were really impressed with the demo and kept telling me it overdelivered and was way better than they expected.

They want SageVoice to call the test group of 250 patients weekly and ask them about their exercise, sleep, diet, social life etc.They currently have nurses doing this work and weren’t going to be able to do the weekly calls.  It feels like a great use of SageVoice’s strengths (structured, conversational).  They also want SageVoice to handle their patient consent conversations, intake and exit surveys.

They want to start in a few weeks, but it’s been hard connecting with them, so I’m not 100% sure it will happen.

When I reached out to them, I told them I was doing pilots for free at this stage.  But looking at the volume, this pilot could be 4,000 hours (or roughly 2 full-time interviewers doing nothing but interviews 40 hours a week).  It could cost me up to $20k and arguably save them $200k in staff.  Good margins, but not for a free pilot.  I flagged that we’ll have to discuss.

## The fast paced prioritization dance.

Working on a 1 person startup that doesn’t have product market fit yet, I’m constantly executing, gathering data, and then figuring out the next best step.

I’m trying to:

- Validate the business model as fast as I can
- Avoid overbuilding (the most common mistake).

With such limited resources (me) and time as my enemy, I’m re-prioritizing almost daily. Asking “what is the thing I need to figure out most” or “what is the biggest blocker to the next step”. Another way of saying this is that my time-horizon is very short. I’m not making 1-year plans, I’m making 1 month plans.

As an example, after some customer calls, I realized I need to automate testing. But in order to benefit from this, I need clean logs (basically the computer telling me what happened and why). That is it’s own mini coding project.  Is this a worthwhile use of time or should I just continue manually testing?  Ultimately, it turns out my clients are very sensitive to errors.  So automated testing is necessary to ensure pilot success.

Similarly, there is an issue with the length of pauses the Bot takes before responding.  Do I spend a few days on this, or do I try to find more potential customers to get feedback.  (The answer here is “no”, because it’s not a blocking issue…yet).  But in 2 weeks, it might become a blocker.

It’s a constant state of flux.

Given that my entire career has been in product management, this is a dance I’m used to. But I don’t think I’ve ever done it at such small time-scales (prioritizing projects on a day-level) and with such little overhead.

I find it really invigorating, because what drives me is when work is unpredictable, but it’s also really intense.  I think there is probably a happy medium with fewer car crashes.

## What makes a business viable?

So I’ve mentioned that researchers are responding to the premise of scaling research subject interactions through voice agents and so far, they are impressed with what the product can do.  That is great!

However, that is necessary step 1 of creating a viable business.  I mentioned competition a couple weeks ago.  That is another concern that comes to folks pretty readily.  But some other questions are so fundamental that you may not be considering them, but they’re just as important.

I am sure there are more rigorous approaches to thinking about this, but this is what comes to mind when I think about what I need to validate and it is roughly sequential.  For instance, I don’t know how many customers I need until I know my profit/customer.

1. Solving a problem (better than alternative, etc)

   1. People pick up the phone
   2. Consistent enough results

2. Customers are willing to pay

   1. Can researchers just add budget line items (not so easy)
   2. Need to validate this ASAP

3. Business is profitable per customer (unit economics)

   1. We can charge more per call than it costs
   2. We can acquire and onboard a client for more than it costs

4. Market is big enough

   1. If each customer brings $X in profit, are there enough to support the business

5. We have a defendable position (moat)

   1. There are 7+ categories here. I am obsessed with moats, but this isn’t obvious to me yet. New data keeps changing how I think about this.

I don’t know yet if this business is viable and that’s kind of stressful.  I’ve been so swamped with execution, trying to get the system HIPAA ready, stable and scalable, but I want to start dedicating some 10-15% of my time towards exploring these questions.

## Last week:

- **Customer Development**

  - Demo for Dementia Prevention study in Southern California went really well!  They have a 400 patient study, with 250 in the \_\_ group.  They want weekly calls checking in on the patients’ diet, sleeping habits, etc.

- **Product Development:**

  - Dead ended approach: the open source framework I’m using doesn’t yet support using GPT4 Realtime to get improved transcriptions.
  - Got new cognitive diagnostic up and running

- **HIPAA**

  - Gruntwork**.** Following best practices around software security makes testing harder. For example, I moved the database to a private network. It can now only be accessed through my production-environment.

- **Family fun**

  - The zoo field trip was great.  My first grader dressed up because it coincided with a holiday they invented that requires a costume.

_I’m so proud of his weird._

## This week

- **Customer Development**

  - Planning for Dementia Prevention study in Southern California.
  - Trying to establish MOUs with pilot partners (basically have them say “we will pay for this if pilot works”)
  - Meeting with the Berkeley Dean of Public Health and their director of research development!

- **Product Development:**

  - Start testing new “cognitive diagnostic”

- **HIPAA**

  - More than I thought here.  I can’t tell if the folks I hired to get me to certification are limiting this to what is required or not. It seems like I’m already compliant with HIPAA, and now it’s just best practices.

## Stock Photo of the Week

I cannot believe this, but my stock photo provider will now change the race of the people in your images.  On the one hand, this is mildly offensive, but on the other hand, it feels pretty magical.  There are vastly more pictures of white people in stock imagery.  If you want to represent a diverse set of users in your ads or website, it could be hard to find the right image. But you can now do this much more easily.

Here are some examples:

_At least_ the first two pages of results for “woman skiing” are of caucasian women.

Here is an image I started with:

Here are two ‘single-button’ alterations:

Wild, right?
