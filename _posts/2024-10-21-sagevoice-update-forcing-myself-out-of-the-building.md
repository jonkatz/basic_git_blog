# Hey, It’s been too long!

Literally. I forgot what happened over these last 2 weeks and had to review my schedule ;).  We’ll see how long this biweekly schedule holds.

**Reminder in case you also forgot**

SageVoice reduces loneliness among seniors using the latest in AI + voice technology.

Thanks to Zeph for helping me explain the concept simply for a recent application:

**Request- 2 multiple choice questions**

If you have seen my requests for interviews or requests for beta testers and haven’t approached an elderly person in your life, that’s TOTALLY understandable.  Here’s an anonymous survey to help me understand cause of the gap between “Mom needs this” and where you’re at.

**These last 2 weeks**

* I spoke to two different senior residences, both of whom expressed interest in running a pilot of the SageVoice Stories product (it interviews you about your history). I should have an update later this week from the more promising one. 🤞
* Applied to the AARP Agetech Collaborative
* Sat down with a user for over an hour while they tried to use their computer. It was illuminating!  Voice or “no interface” will be a great replacement for anything technical.
* Bummers

  + Did not make the cut for two things I applied for:

    - this round of the PearX accelerator
    - Matter’s Accelerating Innovation in Aging program (haven’t heard from them…)
  + After putting some light effort into showing people “how this product works” [demo, images, FAQ], I reran a small ad campaign to drive traffic. I still saw a major dropoff on the purchase page.  So…something else is at play here.
* I made some product improvements based on user testing. I’d love more testers! Particularly for the product that is more like a daily journal entry “What did you do today? How are you doing?”
* Some great meetings with people from all over the space: seniors, founders, potential cofounders, VCs,
* Wrote a new script for interviewing seniors and caregivers to better understand objections.
* Started reading a fantasy series my 9 year old likes. She is 1 book ahead and the queen of spoilers!

**This Week: Outreach**

As an early-stage founder, talking to users is the thing I am most likely to under-invest on. So without application deadlines, or significant software issues to fix, I’m going to try and focus on outreach to set up conversations.

* I know the current framing is an obstacle for caregivers concerned about their parents. I want to get feedback from potential users on some potential solutions. It’s time to get further outside my comfort zone to recruit people. I’d like to set up 10 interviews for the next 2 weeks.
* I still have only talked to a few people at senior living facilities. They’re hard to reach. I had a goal of talking to 3 this month, and I’ve talked to 2.  I’m increasing the goal up to 4.
* I started some co-founder outreach last week. My goal is to reach out to 5 people each week for a while and see what that leads to.

Wow. I don’t know where to start.  From the raised eyebrow, to the one-handed clipper stance…No notes.

That’s it for now!

**As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!**
