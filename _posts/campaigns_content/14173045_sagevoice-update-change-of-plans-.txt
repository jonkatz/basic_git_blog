** Change of plans…
------------------------------------------------------------

Hey All,

I hope you’re enjoying spring! I survived Spring Break and a mountain of Jell-O.  I also rode in my first autonomous taxi. You can listen to whatever you (or your seven year old (or the seven year old inside of you)) wants!

** My plans lasted a week! 😆
------------------------------------------------------------

Last time I shared a plan and acknowledged that plans rarely survive reality, but this may be a new record. On the one hand, the plan started smoothly: both PIs for my free pilots agreed to sign an MOU stating that this is something they would pay for on future studies.

In my abstract thinking, with free pilots underway and had proven interest, I could drum up some paid pilots in academia starting in July-ish.

Well…that was extremely naive.  It took just one, overdue conversation to reveal it. In academia, there aren’t a lot of discretionary funds: you have to be written into the budget pretty explicitly at the proposal stage.  And for clinical trials it is often 12-18 months.  At this early stage, I can’t wait for an 18 month sales cycle to start earning revenue.  The long sales cycle is exacerbated by a low survival rate: not all research is funded.

As you can see above, I thought I’d start exploring “pharma” (by which I lazily mean all non-academic clinical research) starting in June.  I thought I had a couple months where I could focus on execution and “cruise” in terms of market development, simply refining my approach to academic clinical research. But instead I have to start with “pharma” now. I think I need to learn how the problem’s identified for academic clinical research translates to “pharma”, who the decision makers are there, etc.

What this means for my brain
On the one hand I’m excited to deep dive into a space I have little insight into.  On the other hand, I find the networking aspect, which is so crucial to getting insights, to be hard and uncomfortable.

Everyone has the work they procrastinate and for me it’s outreach. I know I have to learn to enjoy it if I’m going to run a successful business.  And I’m getting more comfortable, I’m finding myself randomly talking to folks in the checkout lines more often and it’s delightful. But outreach is not reflexive the way other things are for me and I find myself doing anything besides this work when it’s on my plate.

So a month or so of mostly doing work that didn’t feel like work, I’m shifting back to “work”.

Wish me luck!  And if you know anybody who works on clinical trials who might be willing to chat, my brain will be forever grateful.


** Last week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Market Development
+ The principal investigator (PI) for the Columbia pilot is willing to sign what amounts to a Letter-of-intent stating that while the pilot is free, he would be willing to pay for it, should it deliver on the promise.  That is very important for proving the value and raising money.
+ I met with Berkeley Public Health’s head of research development- she was really positive, and followed up right afterward, but her next step was to share my materials with labs. Showing up in her weekly newsletter is not the kind of warm intro that I think will drive anything.
+ I also met with Stanford’s School of Medicine’s research technology leads. They were decidedly lukewarm–they have their own engineering department and are doing experiments with text-based AI. Definitely nothing coming from this in the short term, but maybe if the name comes up again, now they’ll have some recognition?

* Product Development:
+ Got a BAA from OpenAI (which means I can use them with patient data).  Many thanks to Will for connecting me to his friend there who pushed me through the system with white gloves.
o The night and day difference between their standard responses and “friend of the company” responses was uncanny. Relationships matter.
+ Set up a better staging server, lots of automated testing and dealing with production issues.  Scaling is not straightforward.
* HIPAA/Privacy
+ Built a secure way for customers to upload patient data and retrieve transcripts.  This was the last big pole in the HIPAA tent.


** This week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Market Development
+ Deep and wide dive into “pharma”. I mentioned above that I learned that it will take 1.5 years for a given academic lead to turn into revenue.  So if I want to start earning revenue (and I do!) I need to kick off the exploration of corporate clinical trials sooner than I had originally thought.  This means understanding the ecosystem, identifying decision makers and understanding their problems and priorities… It’s not starting from scratch, since there are a lot of parallels, but it’s a lot of work.
o First stage here is the basic desk research so I don’t sound like an idiot
o The second stage is to conduct some interviews and make some industry connections.
+ I need to refine my pitch.  I am in the process of shifting from pure data collection to selling and I need to figure out the right pace

* Product Development:

I’ve mentioned a bunch that I have automated testing.  In case you’ve forgotten, automated testing is when you have a computer run through a series of scenarios on your website or app to make sure it responds correctly.  For voice…that means that a voice agent calls the app and the two bots talk. You can give the test bot a backstory, motivation, even an emotion.

It’s sick, perverse, and amazing.

Every time I make a significant update, I test on staging by sending a few bots over at a time before pushing the changes live.

Here’s an impressive (relatively boring) example of it working.

BUT, sometimes they just interrupt each other repeatedly, which is amazing.  The illusion of a multi-modal ‘intelligence’ comes crashing down.
