Heya,

I hope you’re all enjoying the start of fall. The last month has been wacky for me, mostly because I’m navigating what it looks and feels like to wind-down a startup, while figuring out what I’m doing next.

Don’t worry, this is not going to turn into a personal “follow my career” email.  This is the second-to-last email from me about SageVoice.

Today’s topic is “what went wrong”.  Next time, I’ll cover what I think I did right!

1. How dead is SageVoice?
2. Mistakes I made
3. (Maybe) Mistakes I made?
4. End result: Why the offering failed


** How dead is SageVoice?
------------------------------------------------------------

A number of people have asked what it means that I’m winding SageVoice down. I think there are phases here.
* Phase 1:
+ Name: Hibernation
+ Timing: pre-new-adventure
+ Characteristics:
o Wrap up pilot with Columbia (we’re hoping to publish results of the pilot!)
o Keep the domain up in case anything comes up– at this stage, SageVoice could still be revived if something changed.
o Keep up the appearance of running a startup so I don’t look unemployed.
* Phase 2:
+ Name: Bones
+ Timing: post-new-adventure—> I stop working on related projects
+ Characteristics:
o Shut down the website.
o SageVoice is officially done, but keep SageVoice LLC as an entity
o Basically, the cost of keeping Sagevoice alive every year is $800 to the state of CA.  The advantage of keeping it alive are:
# I have open accounts in its name, and AWS credits
# costs associated with SageVoice projects are business losses and tax deductible
# I have some “limited liability” by working through a corporate entity.

I’m convinced, this is the right approach that is just too early.  There’s a world in which, a year from now, the market is ready for this and I revive it…I think that chance is pretty slim.


** Mistakes I made
------------------------------------------------------------


** I was competition averse
------------------------------------------------------------

Market selection is a huge part of success or failure.  You want to find an attractive market, but you want one in which you can reasonably have an advantage that earns you customers.

As a solo founder without a clear “Moat”, I didn’t want to enter a space that was dominated by better-funded, better-suited startups.  So I specifically sought out areas where the market was smaller, where there were significant hurdles and I was in the first wave of people with an offering. I wrote about this on LinkedIn here (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/katzjon_im-running-away-from-easy-and-its-hard-activity-7330623382863958016-WcLu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAgaYQB8RrAxyqy9iWy-StX8NfJfZFqw3Q) .

In doing so, I ended up trying to sell something that hadn’t existed before in fields that were risk averse.  I think if I had just tried to execute better on an idea that already had adoption, I would have had more traction.


** I Centered on the tech rather than customers
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a trite lesson, and one that, as a longtime product person, I’m embarrassed to have made.

I think there are times when you start with the tech.  That is, if you’re a researcher or deep tech expert and you made a breakthrough with many potential applications.  Another is if, as with AI, we’re not sure what it can do and so we have to play around and see.

I actually started with a particular problem that I thought voice agents could help with.  But I ended up getting more interested in the voice agent capabilities than the problem itself. This is the dark side of following my passion (which I’ll talk about next time).

This tech-centering creates a disadvantage, because:
* You’re solving the wrong problem: you’re just trying to find a problem you can solve with your tool–and it might not be a problem that is important to your customer (see below).
* You’re overbuilding and not talking to customers enough: It was easier for me to build than it was to talk to customers.  This led me to overbuild and then offer a solution, rather than build what was being asked for.

I think I might have been more successful if I had started agnostically with senior living centers and tried to identify a high-priority problem and try to solve it from there.  FWIW, I do know at least a few entrepreneurs who tried the latter and haven’t had much success either.  I suspect there are many places where the priority problems are people-problems or real-world limitations and can’t be solved (yet) by software.


** I chased mild interest
------------------------------------------------------------

I failed fast with the first product (chatbot for seniors), because the silence was deafening. That is a good thing!

However, when I got
mild interest from researchers, I followed it as though it were solid gold. Part of this is that my calibration was off, because of the earlier rejection.  But the other part was that after consistent rejection, it felt good to have someone interested in moving forward. So I punted important doubts I had in order to pursue that path. I think my rationale was that if I followed the interest, it would lead me to something valuable.  This may have turned out to be true in the long run…but definitely not in the short run.

The conventional wisdom is not to stop until you find something that customers are begging you for.  Recognizing that I buy lots of things I wouldn’t “beg” for, I discounted this as a VC-angled view of the world in which only home-runs ($1billion companies) matter.  But, I think I was wrong.

In future endeavors, I will have to remember that mild interest means “no”, at least in enterprise.  The reason it means no is that, due to switching costs, inertia, and limited attention, there is a huge barrier to new product adoption. In my case, offering 50% savings/convenience on a specific area of the business that wasn’t a big part of their budget was not compelling enough.

I waited till my 40s.

Much has been said about the value of being young while starting a company.  I agree with all of it. To sum it up briefly, a 20 something year old who has money in the bank and no social obligations can work harder and take bigger risks than me. I have a mortgage, a wife, 2 kids, 2 cats and a sick Dad. In any given week, I had 30 hrs of time dedicated to my family.  My hardest working weeks were nowhere near 80 hours and my runway was a year.

Not a staged photo!  The kids are older, but it still feels this way sometimes.

In my search for a potential cofounder, I think my age also got in the way. I was on the “dating website” and there is an age filter.  I left mine blank, but only people in their 40s were showing up for me.  I suspect younger people are not stoked to go to the mat with an old.  And for the reasons above + social, I don’t blame them.

While I have “wisdom” from being older and believe I would be better suited to
run and grow a company after it’s been founded, I think that same wisdom kept me from making the kinds of irrational decisions that are more likely to lead to success of some sort.

While I can learn from the other mistakes, unfortunately, I can’t remedy this one.  But it is not going to be a reason I don’t do another startup!


** (Maybe) Mistakes I made?
I’m not sure if these were mistakes or not…
Mostly avoided incubators/funders
------------------------------------------------------------

10 years ago, you usually needed to raise before you built anything, but I got the impression early on that with today’s incredible tech stack + AI, external funders/validators needed to see traction before they invested.  After applying to very specific incubators (age-tech), not getting past the first round, I looked at who got in and they all had some traction.  So I decided I needed some sort of market traction before I tried to get any external interest.

I took the advice not to talk to investors until I was ready to raise, in part because I wanted to focus on customers and partly because I’m shy.

I probably should have dabbled here more.  The reason is twofold.
1. Clearer thinking: Just by preparing materials for presenting, I would have been forced to layout my theories more linearly and possibly uncovered opportunities.
2. Better connections: I spoke to 3 VCs, all in the first month.  Khosla Ventures was the first and they immediately introduced me to 3 amazing connections: 1 industry expert, and 2 potential clients.

I’m proud that I didn’t fall into typical pitfalls of chasing VC faustian bargains. But maybe I went to far here.


** Spent a lot of time trying to find a cofounder
------------------------------------------------------------

Co-founder “dating”, is like most online dating.  And like most online dating, most dates don’t turn into marriage. I met with maybe 3 dozen potential cofounders over the course of 18 months and also took part in a co-founder finding incubator of sorts (ODF).

While I didn’t find a cofounder, and indeed, most of the conversations were a waste of time, some of them were incredibly educational and some of the people I “dated”, ended up being “just friends” in that we’re supportive of each other and still in touch.  Really high leverage.

One insight I learned at ODF, is that it’s hard to bring on a cofounder if you’re already obsessed with something. I think for my next endeavor, I’d like to bring someone on first and then get obsessed together.

End result: Why the offering failed

My mistakes manifested a product that wasn’t the right fit. But what specifically about it was wrong?

Ultimately, the startup failed twice.  There was the “loneliness chatbot for the elderly” and the “research voice agent”.

In both cases, AI voice agents are novel enough that the risk and stigma did not outweigh the benefit.  I am very confident that, in time, both use cases will see widespread adoption.

Loneliness chatbot for the elderly:
* The bot “worked”...but that didn’t matter.
* Addressing a huge problem “loneliness”, but not one that people want to put money against. Individuals don’t want to acknowledge and institutions don’t prioritize it.
* Generally speaking, the older you are, the more distrustful you are of AI.  This was the wrong segment.
* Combatting loneliness with a machine is something nobody wanted to pitch (I understand)--iterations focused on social connection didn’t work either.
* When you add up the problem and the solution, this is a tough market.

Research voice agent
* Voice agents are, generally speaking, not yet as good as humans in conversation.  So their value lies in spaces where volume of calls is high, and enterprises are willing to take a cut in outcomes in order to reach more people.  Clinical research is not that space.
+ Study participants are high-value assets and, in many trials, they are hard to find. If they were hard to sift through, then an AI makes more sense, but I didn’t encounter trials willing to take that risk.
+ Researchers are generally risk averse. The gain in productivity or extra data wasn’t worth any potential risk to FDA approval or result quality.
o Most people I spoke to, whether it was oncologists or psychologists, felt that the subject matter was too sensitive for a bot.  Here is a quote from an email: After our conversation, I spoke with Doug and we agreed that while the technology is very impressive, we don't see a use for it in our current trials given the sensitivity of our data collection.
o Others wanted to see validation through study first.

For those of you who skipped this, I’d summarize as “ the risk and stigma did not outweigh the benefit”.


** Your Moment of Zen
------------------------------------------------------------

That’s what I have for now! Despite the focus of this email being failure, I am really really happy I did this. In the words of Gavin Belson, I consider this to be “pre-greatness”.

I’ll talk about that more next time.
