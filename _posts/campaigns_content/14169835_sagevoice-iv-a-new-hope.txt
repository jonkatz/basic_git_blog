** SageVoice IV: A New Hope
------------------------------------------------------------


** Ask of you
------------------------------------------------------------

Does anybody know someone in the hospice field? I’m having trouble reaching them.


** Great Calls
------------------------------------------------------------

After a bummer of a few weeks, and the funeral of my original vision, I had some encouraging calls last week.
* a care manager (I met at a networking event) who wanted to explore using SageVoice to call her clients, check in on them and track progress over time.  We’re going to follow up this week to see what that would look like.
* a lab coordinator responding to my outreach that week who wants to explore SageVoice as a way of screening study participants. He’s supposed to send me some sample interviews this week.


** Pivoting to what?
------------------------------------------------------------

I mentioned that I was pivoting last week. A pivot could mean anything.  It could mean that I’m swapping every dimension of the model out and I’m opening up an ice cream shop or doing the same thing, but with devices instead of phone calls.

In this case, it ends up meaning that I’m keeping the phone call AI thing in place, and swapping out combinations of the other directions.

Below is a review of how it breaks down, followed by the new directions I’m exploring.

Over the last few months, I broadened from my approach as a precursor to this pivot, as I started getting signals that the original approach wasn’t right.

Original model:

Expanded approaches:

Pivot = ruling out original

In place of the removed dimensions, here are some leads I want to track down:
* Structured interviews for:
+ Study participant recruitment
* Frequent phone-call→narrative updates for:
+ Medical providers (this is what the ACO reached out to me about)
+ Clinical researchers
* Patient biographies for medical providers (see news article (https://kffhealthnews.org/news/mini-biographies-help-clinicians-connect-with-patients/) shared by Zeph)
* Patient engagement (life story collection) for hospice

Now it looks like this (green = new)

These are all areas where I have enough of a hint that I think is worth looking into, but by no means do I have conviction.  Next week, I’ll do a post mortem on why my approach to voice companions for the elderly hit snags.


** Last week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Outreach: Outreach towards: Hospice, ACOs, and academics (send a couple dozen emails), 1 interview
* Flogging dead horse: One final ad test confirmed that the new funnel wasn’t making a difference.
* Maintenance: Set up a new user tester and fixed bugs


** This week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Learning: Several interviews scheduled
* Outreach: More outreach + desk research
* Build: Prototype for the lab I spoke to
