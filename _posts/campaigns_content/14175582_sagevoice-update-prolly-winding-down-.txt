Hey There,

Wow, it’s been awhile: 3 weeks longer than usual. I haven’t been ignoring you, it was for a planned vacation.  Since this email is all about sharing insights, here’s some wisdom I picked up: while your startup is running out of runway, don’t take a long vacation with small kids, dependent Dad, and extended family.

Despite not following my own advice, the vacation was peppered with some great moments. My Dad is increasingly incoherent, but he got a real kick out of spending time with grandkids.

Summer is winding down. I hope you have had some moments like the above before it’s over.

SageVoice is likely winding down too. I have a few more weeks to try, but things are not looking super positive.  I’ll share more about how that feels in a future email.


** Wrong product, wrong message or wrong segment?
------------------------------------------------------------

When you reach out to folks with your offer and get no bites, either you have the wrong solution, aren’t pitching it right, or you’re pitching it to the wrong person.

I’ve been reaching out to clinical trial sites (pharma companies farm out the actual recruitment and delivery to local docs) to see if there was any interest in the version of SageVoice that helps them vet and onboard new trial participants. I have gotten very few email opens, despite toying with the messaging. It’s possible that I’m hitting spam folders…

A friend in the space, Shruti, suggested that I might be targeting the wrong sites. Her theory was that small sites have too few trials/year to justify something that expedites patient onboarding.  Larger site networks, on the other hand, have more patients and might be more interested in streamlining. So I’m going to explore that next.


** I Descoped the pilot
------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve mentioned before that the cognitive diagnostic for our pilot with Columbia is probably not playing to the strengths of voice agents. Today’s voice agents are great at conversation, even at capturing data, but bad at delivering a test that requires highly specific proctoring. In addition, this particular diagnostic is probably one of the hardest we could take on.

After 4 months of getting the bot to deliver the test almost perfectly, I came to the conclusion that we weren’t going to close the remaining gap with our timeline and resources. So instead of comparing the bot’s administration to human administrators, we’re limiting the pilot to see what we can learn from administering it to patients and how the bot scores the test. Scoring, while highly nuanced, can happen asynchronously and is therefore easier to get right.  Our intern started this and I think it will take about 2 weeks of coding ½ time to finish.


** What’s next?
------------------------------------------------------------

With just 4 weeks left to my time and no signs of traction, I’m starting to think about next steps. I’ll leave out the rumination about where my career goes from here, but here are some thoughts about startup-next steps.
1. At the very least, I will keep SageVoice up and running for a while in case the situation changes, or an opportunity arises.
2. Spending time with my Dad really reinforced the value of my approach, which was to serve people with dementia and their caregivers. I might do one last pass on that.
3. I’d like to keep coding and experimenting with voice agents- I’m excited by what video can do in this space, for instance.
4. Along the way, I met some great people. I might loop back with a couple of them to see if they want to start tinkering on a fresh idea.


** Random: copycat?
------------------------------------------------------------

I found this site recently.  https://sageechoai.com/  It’s called SageVoice AI and is modeled off one of the earlier offerings. I wonder if they just go around copying new businesses to see where the interest is.  What a weird business model!


** Last 3 weeks
------------------------------------------------------------
* Market Exploration and Development.
+ Sent emails to about 60 clinical trial sites and got very few “opens” (see above: Wrong product, wrong message or wrong segment?)
+ I think the only thing worth mentioning here is that the new website is live and arguably better than the original


** This week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Product Development
+ Pilot prep and launch:
o Scoring
o Fix something with the recordings


** Media Generation of the Week
------------------------------------------------------------

This isn’t so new, but the open source technology I use is now integrated with video avatars, so you can create an avatar and do a virtual zoom call.  The AI can see the video feed, analyze it and speak in video form. For instance, the AI could ask to see your pill bottles and read the labels or respond to gestures.

I figured I’d quickly create an avatar for you to see, but I haven’t integrated it with chat yet.

I made this last night in less than 15 minutes. I gave it a script to read, but in the future, it could be responding to what the user said or an expression they made in the video.

I personally think the AI camera adds about 15 pounds…

Overall, like so many AI things today, this is imperfect, amazing and scary at the same time.

As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!
