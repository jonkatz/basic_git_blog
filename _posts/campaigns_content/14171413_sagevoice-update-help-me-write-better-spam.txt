** Help me write better spam
------------------------------------------------------------

Hey,

Do you like getting unsolicited mail or email? Neither do I.

Yet now that I have something that might be useful, I honestly feel like I’m doing someone a service by letting them know about it. Life is weird.

On that note, I’d love to hear your opinion on my email to potential clients.

As mentioned, my goal for one of my work-streams this month, serving clinical researchers, is to get more pilots up and running, so that I can learn faster.  My outreach, however, has had mixed results.

I’m in a weird stage on the research front, here, because I have some validation that there is a need. I’m not quite in sales mode yet, though. So I’m looking for someone interested in trying it or feedback on “why not”.

I keep writing to 12 researchers a week (and following up with the researchers from last week).  My hit rate is not great. So far 40 emails have led to 2 demos, 2 “nos” and 36 ignores. The pilot that is going live soon came from a warm intro.

This week I started automating it, using a simple web scraper and an AI-prompt (something like: “This is the researchers area of expertise, here is my goal, please write a short email”.  They have some nice twists in them, but nothing too special.

Here is the email I sent last week:

Subject: Could this help your study? looking for feedback

Body:

Hi Dr. Stahl,

I'd love to get your insights on something that might be relevant to your upcoming trial around early intervention for patients with high risk for CCUS.

I'm currently piloting a technology that lets researchers screen subjects or collect data more effectively, using automated phone AI-voice calls. It's conversational, can provide richer data, and is fully automated.

We are currently moving forward with a cardiology pilot at Columbia, and have bandwidth for more. But even if it's not appealing to you, I'd love your feedback.

Would you or someone in your lab be interested in chatting with me about how you might use something like this? (or not)

Thanks,

Jon

What do you think? Given that busy people ignore most emails, definitely sales emails, what should I do differently?


** Update:
No email next week. Long weekend, family in town, etc.

** New Competitor for my Old Approach
------------------------------------------------------------

At one point, I had a landing page that was oriented around daily calls to your parents (https://www.sagevoice.pro/check-ins-monitor). I abandoned my approach when I couldn’t even get friends and family to sign their loved ones up. Institutions weren’t biting. Paid traffic similarly led nowhere. “Lean startup” rules suggest that if you can’t find anyone who wants it…stop doing it.

There are now 3 services that offer the same thing. All with similar value propositions, and all with better-designed pages. I am meeting the CEO of the latest entrant on Tuesday.  Here is his slick page. https://www.getcarecall.com/

I’m so curious about this.  Are they getting traction? Did I give up too soon? Is better design the difference? Are they just further behind in their learnings? Or are they better funded, going to wait it out and make it work.  I have no doubt that this will someday be a real business, but also unclear how it can function now unless you’re willing to invest a lot up front.


** Last week:
------------------------------------------------------------
* Polished the cardiac survey. It’s ready to go live with the first subjects, when the lab is ready.
* Prepped the depression diagnostic for Tuesday’s demo
* Outreach: No progress here (see above)
* HIPAA research and progress
+ Started migrating my stack to Amazon Web Services (they have built in HIPAA compliance as long as you’re not an idiot)
* Personal note: My Dad finally picked up the phone and talked to my bot.  He was into it! Talked until the system ran out of memory at 45 minutes (I’m on a cheaper server now).


** This week:
------------------------------------------------------------
* Demo and get feedback from Stanford lab on the depression diagnostic interview I made for them.  They postponed this demo for a month, so I’m trying to prepare myself for a lukewarm reception.  🤞
* Outreach:
+ 24 new outreach emails, 12 follow ups.
+ Attending an event on Tuesday in SF about how AI can help the elderly.
* HIPAA:
+ I’m hoping to get a signed document from my transcriber service (Deepgram) that will make it HIPAA compliant. That will be the last piece I need.
+ I need to start writing up a policy and BAA that can be shared with potential customers.

I have no idea what this is. Explanations welcome!

As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!
