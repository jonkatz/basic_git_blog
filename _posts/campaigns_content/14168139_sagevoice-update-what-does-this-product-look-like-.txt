** Looking for lice in all the right places
------------------------------------------------------------

Stock images are weird and amazing

The actual update is past the pictures…

https://sagevoice.pro

the result of a search: “excited entrepreneur”

I am too excited to tell you about stock images!

My goal for October is to make this product less scary, help people understand it. For storytelling and demonstration, pictures and videos are really helpful!!

Without a broad customer base, I’ve been relying a lot on stock images. And it is such a treat!

Stock images have been around for awhile…and they’ve been weird the whole time.  I just didn’t get a chance to play with them before.  Maybe you haven’t either.

What I want to do is just share weird images, but instead here are some take-aways:

* Stock images are cheap: rather than pay per image, there is a subscription model, where for $10 a month, I can download unlimited licensed stock images to use (non-exclusively) in perpetuity.
* Coverage is broad.  Below is just the top of the first page of results for “Dad looking for Lice”. There are pages of solid results.

In case you’re wondering…no, my kids do not have lice (at the moment)
* And they’re now bolstering it with AI images (second row, second from right) and AI similarity detection: the guy in the second row with the mustache prop is in a lice-checking-like position.
* Once you start looking at stock images, you see the same actors on all your competitors' websites. It’s like when you get a new car and then suddenly you notice that car a lot more. I’ve seen one of my  “grandmas” on other people’s sites fall in love, play catch and be cared for in a nursing home.
* Every search turns up something delightfully weird. The search “anxious Dad” turns up Dads looking anxious, but also this:

Prioritization:

OpenAI’s real time voice offering, which I mentioned last week, is now available to developers. It is a much more seamless voice experience and allows for seamless switching of languages, handles multiple voices better, etc.  I had hoped that I could be ready to integrate it quickly, because it makes the product better, but that seems unlikely right now given the more pressing need to hone in on “product market fit”..

Last Week:
* “How does this work?”:  Making the offering less scary/easy to comprehend is the theme of the month. Last week I added a demo video for one version of the product (check it out here (https://www.sagevoice.pro/parent-story) (sounds is off by default), a visual walk-through of the “check in” product (here (https://www.sagevoice.pro/check-ins-monitor) ), and an FAQ to all landing pages and the pricing pages (example (https://www.sagevoice.pro/check-ins-monitor#FAQ) ).
* I also have an engaged senior using the product.  He has an incredible story to share and is very motivated to share it.  He has been testing it and I’ve been fixing the problems he encounters.
* I spoke with an ops director of a large senior living facility who said that hiring/training was his biggest challenge. Did you know the industry employee turnover rate is > 80%!  That is wild.
* Last week I randomly applied to the PearX accelerator.  A friend had mentioned that they were cool and I happened to finally look them up on Monday.  The deadline was within 24 hours. I made a slide deck, intro video, and (the aforementioned) demo video.  It was an intense day.

This Week:
* As always, looking for testers or feedback on why this isn’t a fit for an elderly loved one in your life.
* Start working on the AARP pitch contest application I mentioned last week. The deadline got moved to the 18th.
* Now that I’ve (hopefully) improved the website, running another set of ad campaigns to see which messaging and offering resonate most.

I’m noticing that my weekly swings have been minor recently. I think I’m in week 2 of a repeating cycle, where I listen, iterate, test.  If that continues, I suspect it will be boring for you.  I might write less frequently if there aren’t any exciting updates.

As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!
