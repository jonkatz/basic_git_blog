Hey Folks,

We’re back! At other times even a one week break felt like too much, but lately it’s been heads down on getting the upcoming pilot ready. I wanted to do more outbound sales, but it’s taken a lot more work than I had anticipated to get this pilot right. More on that below.


** Existential time
------------------------------------------------------------

Today marks a year since I started this full time (and 8 months since I pivoted). I gave myself until the end of July 2025 to find traction, I did this because:
1. that felt like a long enough time to figure out if this was a business
2. It is a long time to work without a salary, and I knew it would take time afterwards to find a job

I knew it would be tempting to keep working on something I cared about and I didn’t want this to turn into an expensive hobby and downward economic spiral.

So far, I have not found the traction I hoped for. I wanted 2 paying customers and right now I have one free customer. I know that there are at least 2 companies out there that offer a similar service, so it seems to me that the failure to find customers is not about the product. It’s about me and my efforts/abilities/connections in marketing.

Because I focused on the pilot, I have not personally done anything to gain new customers over the last month. So, I am giving myself another month to focus on that. With a planned family vacation, this extends the deadline until mid-September. Not the sunk cost fallacy, but now that this service is so functional, the extra month feels like a reasonable investment. Keep me honest, though—no more extensions without traction.


** What is SageVoice now?
------------------------------------------------------------

It’s been awhile, so I’m going to lay out what I think SageVoice is.


** Our core value proposition,
------------------------------------------------------------

We solve interviewing subjects at scale, for clinical researchers, by offering structured interviews using AI-enabled telephone calls.

Within that, it’s clear that study recruitment is a clear need within the clinical research community. So is effective data collection. I’m working on both, because they have different success timelines.


** Our Pilot
------------------------------------------------------------

Our primary pilot, in close partnership with Dr. Sachin Agarwal and his team at the University of Columbia Medical Center, involves a cognitive assessment conducted over the phone. Today, administration of the test requires significant training and then assessment of the trainers to ensure that the scoring is done correctly. The test itself is just a measurement tool, so nobody wants to spend this much time on it.

We’ll be looking at what it’s like to administer the test using SageVoice and how SageVoice scores the test compared to humans. The bot will call 15 patients, walk them through the test, and then score it. It will also score tests conducted by humans. The hope is that SageVoice will save time and score consistently enough to avoid a mountain of frustrating effort by the research coordinators.


** Did we overspecialize?
------------------------------------------------------------

The test is a 40 minute series of 9 activities. In retrospect, I know that this is not the optimal use of an AI bot, because administration of the test has to be very precise and consistent.  AI is great at free-flowing conversation, but this test requires very specific sequences and sometimes just one-word answers. The bot can diagnose depression based on a conversation much more effectively than it can consistently deliver a complex set of word prompts. Similarly, most phone calls are less than 15 minutes–a 40 minute phone call is much harder to do.

In building out this complicated series of timed and sequenced activities, I think we have built a system with a rich set of capabilities. On the one hand, I doubt there is another diagnostic bot that can do what ours does and this could be a niche offering.

On the other hand, the clearer market play is patient recruitment and, in pursuing this, we have built far more than we need in one direction and neglected another one that has more short-term potential.


** Last 3 weeks (-1 for vacation)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Product Development
+ Mostly pilot prep:
o The bulk of 2 weeks + nights and weekends was on getting the pilot working smoothly. I won’t bore anyone with the details, but I think we’re in a strong spot now.
o Visited the team the other week in person!
o I handed it to the Columbia team last night to test out before we start bringing it to patients.  More work might come from this.
* Market Exploration and Development.
+ Lukewarm reception to SageVoice.
o Dr. Agarwal presented Sagevoice at a conference and didn’t get much feedback one way or the other.
o We had a stellar demo with a clinical trials site in which the client kept saying how amazing it was, but has since gone silent. It’s just not a priority.
o Another scheduled demo was pushed back.
+ We are now an approved vendor for Columbia University Medical Center
o This is a big deal.
o When I talk to many potential clients, they kind of dismiss the notion of a new tool because of the challenge of getting past their security team.


** Next week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Market Exploration and Development.
+ Better materials
o I’ve been told the shitty website is a turnoff. I’m working on a quick overhaul for looks.
o I’m also thinking of having more visual demos on the site
o We’re now listed on Elion (https://elion.health/products/sagevoice) –I can spruce up our listing
+ Outreach
o Once the site is up, Hugo has some more folks he is going to reach out to
o I have a longstanding meeting with another academic researcher set for Thursday

* Product Development
+ Pilot prep and launch:
o Test scoring- Saalem, our intern, is taking the lead here and making great progress.
o Respond to any feedback


** Media Generation of the Week
------------------------------------------------------------

We’ve talked a lot about the evolution of stock photography here, which turned into AI photo creation, and that has turned into AI video creation. Today, AI website creation. I had been hearing a lot about a tool called “Lovable”, which let’s you vibe code (AI driven coding) an app or user facing website.

In my effort to make the website look more professional, I tried it out. In about 1 hr and using the original site as the starting point (make a site like X but better), I got the following.

Old site:

* New site:

It obviously needs some work, but I think it looks better!  What do you think?

Well, that wasn’t fun at all, so here’s a ridiculous stock image :

(yes a human made this)

Stay groovy!

As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!
