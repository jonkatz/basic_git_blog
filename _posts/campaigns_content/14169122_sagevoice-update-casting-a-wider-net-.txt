** I’m casting a wider net

Personal update

For those of you worried about my knee, I am recovering quickly and already walking a bit on my own. The not-cool news is that they cut me open for nothing. The tissue they thought was torn, was just shitty tissue. I’m disappointed, but I’m not mad. As we say in product development, they “shipped to learn”.

October Goals look-back

October’s goal was to make the product less spooky. I made progress here in terms of trying things, but nothing made a dent in conversions.

My 2 week outreach towards the end of the month was very effective in generating conversations, learnings, and potential leads

I need to broaden my approach before I can focus

I need a validated, clear vision to make money, raise money or attract a cofounder. But the original approach: “Solve loneliness among seniors by having family caregivers buy a voice companion” hasn’t been validated.

So I moved to something like this and similarly, have been getting traction, but not enough.

My work in October to demystify it, did not bear fruit. When your initial approach doesn’t work…you have to change something. So now I’m exploring variations to see whether different value propositions will work.  And, to move fast, I’m considering a number of things to see where I get traction first. This is too much

So my goal for the end of the year is to find enough traction with one of these to narrow my focus.

In November, I’m going to focus on 2 potential pilots, testing one new “value proposition”, and researching a new approach.  That seems like a lot, but pilots have been moving slowly so far.

Last week(s)
* Had a really promising conversation with a startup medical group that provides value-based care to seniors on medicaid. They are looking for something that will help them monitor the more psychological and social factors and want to talk about a pilot.
* The pilot with the senior residence is moving forward. We are starting with a building with ~60 beds and participation will be voluntary.  They want to use it to collect their residents’ stories.
* To support the senior residence pilot, I made the app work in spanish.
* Started a landing page around using SageVoice to connect to family
* Did not get accepted into the AARP AgeTech Collaborative. I did not get any feedback from them. They were a good fit in terms of mission, so if they don’t like me, I think it’s best to take a break from applications until I have traction.

This week
* Finish and test landing page around using SageVoice to connect to family
* Move pilots along
* More conversations around requirements
* Building some needed improvements
* Start to research the academic/pharma research use case.  The concept here is using SageVoice phone calls to collect regular “social histories” of the patient as a data point to inform studies. An example might be that an experimental intervention to treat depression might want to collect if the subjects are stressed at work, made a new friend, impacted by current events, etc.

Stock image of the week:

Are there stock images of protests? Yes there are!  And amazingly enough, the creators make the signs blank so that you can make them shout about anything.

I don’t know if I’ll find anything this amazing again.  Apologies for peaking so soon.

As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!
