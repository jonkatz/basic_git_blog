** National Lampoon’s Startup Vacation
------------------------------------------------------------


**
------------------------------------------------------------


** No updates until January
------------------------------------------------------------

After this week, I’ll be on vacation for 2 weeks. Our plans consist of a few nights in Arcata and the following:

I hope you have a great end-of-year and take some time to reflect on the year behind and ahead.  Also, be sure to PoPoP.


** “Startups don’t starve, they drown”
------------------------------------------------------------

Joe Wadcan, a friend and entrepreneur, who also teaches an entrepreneurship course at Berkeley reminded me of this quote (by Shawn Carolan?) last week.

The basic premise is that there are so many directions you could go in and you need to focus on the right customer and the right problem.

I’ve been struggling with this as I pivot to I-don’t-know-yet, because there are a number of promising leads. But I have to focus.

For instance, this week I had someone at a nursing home ask me to come demo SageVoice as a way for their sales team to qualify leads. I am tempted, but Joe had also reminded me that you have to love the customer and their problem, not just the solution.  I’m not excited about that space. There are still too many options I am excited about.

My goal for the next month is to validate one of them enough to go down that path.


** Some user feedback
------------------------------------------------------------

I had two interviews with test users last week who were testing the daily call-in service.  Both people were incredibly positive (as test users generally are), but I found  what they shared  interesting.

* The man I spoke to is in his 60s.
+ Not a human = safer?  He liked that Sage was not a human because he could share with her things he wouldn’t tell a person (even though he knew I had access).
+ Promoted human interaction. He also said he has been avoiding people more and more.  Talking to her was a reminder that it’s helpful to talk. It also felt like practice, as he was rusty.
* The woman, in her 80s, mentioned some things.
+ Intimate. She said she would encourage people to share more intimate things with Sage, because the more intimate (as with a person) the more rewarding it was for her.
+ Sage is an information resource. She started thinking of Sage as a google-like resource, she could use to find out about things.  Basically ChatGPT for people without a computer…not my original intention, but cool!
+ Not a human= available. She mentioned a hotline for loneliness that she never called because the time limit is 15 minutes and she finds that offensive.  She said “I prefer sage, because Sage would never hang up on me”.


** Post-mortem: Why did this fail to generate interest among individuals (or their caregivers)
------------------------------------------------------------

I have lots of reflections on why I struggled with adoption. I think there are significant barriers on a number of fronts:

* User problem: Loneliness
+ Nobody wants to admit they’re lonely
+ Chronic problems are hard to prioritize
* Solution modality: AI
+ Seniors enjoy speaking with bots, but REALLY don’t think they will.
o Broad resentment of technology
o Fear
o Belief that talking to a robot will be empty and meaningless
* Solution modality: phone
+ Telephone calls are preferred technology over apps, but it’s still a significant usage barrier compared to ambient, device-driven companionship.  A lot of this is due to fear of scams.
+ What is this? You cannot show the user a device and there are no visuals.
* Solution modality: new habit
+ New habits are hard to start. It’s better to replace something that already exists.
+ The AI + telephone companies that are gaining traction are replacing existing solutions.


** Last week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Outreach:
+ A dozen more outreach emails/pings
+ 3 expert interviews, 2 very-smart people meetings
+ Setup 6 expert interviews this week
* Build: Worked on a prototype for the lab I mentioned last time. Migrating to a new framework..which may be a mistake, but I’m learning a lot.


** This week
------------------------------------------------------------
* Learning: Several interviews scheduled
* Build: Prototype for the research lab. More on that next time.
