** What does a pre-revenue startup cost?
------------------------------------------------------------


**
------------------------------------------------------------

My family and I were sick most of last week, so it was mostly a wash.  I had, however, already reviewed my spending and wrote up some thoughts.

The value here is not my interpretation, but seeing live numbers for what someone is spending (and the vendors I’m using). If you want to skip to that, here’s a link to my monthly-spend spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQxwEd2XPnr1l4cLpVQ1rPOMQDyQD7qcKRZQJCyz-5s/edit?usp=sharing) .

I’m very interested in hearing whether you think there are areas I should be spending more to move/learn faster.


** Spending: Obligatory Context
------------------------------------------------------------

All my spending data is for a startup where I am pre “product-market fit”.  My primary activities are:
* user interviews
* built several variations of a working “pilot product” that is live and usable (but not what you’d scale with)
* engaged in user testing of those variations

I am pre-revenue, pre-fundraise, pre-marketing and pre-employee.


** How I spent money so far
------------------------------------------------------------

Ignoring for a moment the much larger opportunity cost of a foregone salary, we’re left with rather small numbers, but they’re interesting nonetheless: mostly because they’re so small.

It is cheap to start a software company. I literally mean “start” here, because cost comes with scale.

Overall, I’ve spent about $8k.  Which is a lot to spend on air, but is a remarkably small number so spend getting a consumer facing website and app prototype out in front of a large number of people. At least, I think it is.

There are several categories of cost.

Annual (small)
* Overall, I had some upfront startup costs of creating a business (LLC in CA), which were ~$1000. It ends up being roughly that a year in licensing.
* Web domains are another $200 since I have accumulated a few.  That’s just a discipline issue.

On-offs (large)
* At this stage, the majority of my spending has been one-off purchases
* The bulk of my costs were my google ad experiments, which ran at ~$3k.  Roughly $300 per hypothesis.  I got directional information about which value propositions worked better at this small volume, but not specific messaging insights.
* Paying some supplemental user testers to play with a version of the product over a period of time and let me interview them, cost another $300.
* I paid a web developer $300 to make a few pages on my website more mobile friendly (I ended up redoing that work)

Monthly fixed (medium)
* My current fixed costs (accumulating over time) are now at ~$400/month. Here is a rough breakdown.

Product = what it costs to keep the product online and functional.

Development = cost of tools used to build the product.

* Here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQxwEd2XPnr1l4cLpVQ1rPOMQDyQD7qcKRZQJCyz-5s/edit?usp=sharing) is the spreadsheet (same as above) where I have broken these down with descriptions and  you can geek out on all the numbers if you’re interested.  Here is a subset.

* The bulk here is subscriptions to support a website, outreach tools.
* Very notably, the cost of developing and hosting a product are small and go up with scale.  Unlike a restaurant, my bills are almost 0 until I have customers.

Scaling
* The bulk of my costs are marginal costs, meaning that I pay per usage. I have such low volume now that these costs are minimal.
* If I need to be HIPAA compliant at some point, that will likely require some “minimum purchase agreements” with various providers, but otherwise there aren’t any big cash outlays I have to make pre-revenue.


** Reflecting
------------------------------------------------------------

$8k is a relatively small amount.  Because the bulk of my cost is foregone salary, should I be spending more to try and learn faster? Spending an extra $1000 a month would be worth it, if it meant I return to a salary sooner.  What has stopped me?
1. It’s harder to spend real money than “opportunity cost” money.
2. I just haven’t found the thing where “if I spend this $1k, I will save X time”.  Maybe hiring a consultant or paying for more user interviews would have saved time.

What do you think?

There was some great entries!

Apropos of nothing happening in the news this week, I typed in the search term “idiot king” and found a surprising number of guys in crowns giving folks a double middle-finger. Stock Image of the week

Apropos of nothing happening in the news this week, I typed in the search term “idiot king” and found a surprising number of guys in crowns giving folks a double middle-finger.

I suppose that’s a fair representation of the history of kings, but I still find it somewhat odd.

What’s with the thumbs?

This guy’s confidence.  🤌
