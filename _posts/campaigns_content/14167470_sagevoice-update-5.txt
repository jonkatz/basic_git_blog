** It’s alllliiiive!
------------------------------------------------------------

Hey there,

I hope you had a stupendous weekend.  SageVoice as an mvp has been live for awhile..but now Sagevoice is in a place where a stranger could find the site, sign up, pay and expect an actual product.

Context

As a reminder, SageVoice uses AI + voice to solve for the caregiver gap in eldercare. The primary aim is to eventually offer a social companion to support seniors who are socially isolated, but I’m exploring a couple of paths to get there.

My goals for September are to build a new prototype/use case, start testing it, and apply for an accelerator.

Last week

It was a great week in which I wrapped up a number of streams:
* Finished the scheduling functionality.  You can now set up the service to call at specific times:

* Finished migrating the website from squarespace to webflow.  The new website is here (https://www.sagevoice.pro/) , with different landing pages for different offerings (parent’s story, (https://www.sagevoice.pro/parent-story) your story (https://www.sagevoice.pro/story) , monitor your parent (https://www.sagevoice.pro/check-ins-monitor) ).  I’d love feedback on the site/messaging here.
+ This was necessary to give people account settings like the image above
* Added payments, so you can actually “buy” SageVoice now
* Started a google ad campaign to drive traffic.  This is not yet generating any solid traffic, but here is an example of what an ad might look like:

Note: This ad sucks. What happens with google ads is that you create a number of pieces of text, they combine them and test the combinations.  I’ll have to spend time figuring out the right messaging.

This week

The primary theme of this week is going to be learning
* Now that I have this new “monitor” use case and scheduling functionality, I want to have people try it.  If you would be willing to try it yourself or for your parents, let me know!! (or visit the site, pick a product and here is a code to use it for free: BETATESTER)
* Learn from what happens when strangers click on ads and visit the site.  I’ll share some data next week!
* Talk to VCs on Wednesday? (they pushed it back)
* Also: starting to prep my application for the accelerator

Mental update

If you made it this far, you get the juicy stuff. I’m two months in and starting to see some unhealthy patterns. I have been working till bedtime and go to bed vibrating with things I want to finish or investigate.  It’s affecting my sleep.  I’m going to try and set better boundaries.
