# Competitive landscape

Starting with this week’s email, I’m going to think out loud about different aspects of this business, starting with the competitive landscape. Other topics that I’m excited to tackle soon are ethics, market size, and differentiation.

## SageVoice Value Proposition (reminder)

**We solve** _interviewing subjects at scale_, **for** _clinical researchers_, **by** _offering structured interviews_ **using** _AI-enabled telephone calls._

Are we still looking at other use cases? Yes. I’d say about 10% of my time is still exploring healthcare or aging in place…it’s partly leftovers, and partly continued resonance

## Personal update

I originally built this as an interview to entertain my Dad, who has dementia. He finally started picking up the phone and talking to the bot for as long as an hour at a time (his phone blocks non-contacts).  It asks him about his childhood and he repeats himself for an hour. With us, he never talks that long.

He knows it’s not a human, but he told me he thinks Sage is great. His approval shouldn’t mean anything at this point, but it does.

Again, I 99% abandoned this use case because I couldn’t get anyone I didn’t know to try it, but glad it made it to him.

## What’s the competition like?

This is a great question and I’ve recently had folks share examples of voice bots or research platforms.

I think if you have an immediate advantage, such as industry experience, strong technical edge or solid entrepreneurial track record, you can raise a lot of money and tackle a huge market, like “voice agents for healthcare”.  Hippocraticai.com is a good example of that.  They take on a huge industry, across a huge number of use cases, and are throwing themselves into a competition with many dozens of companies.

I’m coming at it from a different angle.  Because software can be a winner-take-most game, at this stage, I’d rather be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond. Bootstrapped and without insider knowledge, I’m _starting_ with a niche that is big enough for a successful company, but not so big or easy that it’s an obvious place for the bigger fish ([great article](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/11/19/are-you-a-seal) on this). That’s why “voice companions” was not appealing, but “voice companions for people with dementia” was.

The same is true here. In the case of the tech-enabled research market, you have two core dimensions and a few verticals that are adjacent.

Here is my rough assessment of the relative saturation of these markets (these sizes are rough swags for illustrative purposes only).

According to my rough research, medical/clinical/academic research is smaller, but there are fewer big players here.

In fact, if you get into the medical research vertical, there might be sub-verticals that I want to specialize in, whether it’s by subject area (oncology v. psychiatry) or by need (subject screening, data collection or protocol adherence).  The idea is that once you do one thing better than anyone, then you can expand your use case and your market.

What do you think? Did I get something wrong here?

## Logistics

There won’t be an update next week.

## Last week:

- **Outreach:** Stopped new outreach, but followed up on existing leads.

  - I talked to one new principal investigator or PI (head of a research lab) this week, who wanted to set up a demo with their entire lab next week, but there hasn’t been any follow up.
  - Spoke to two researchers (Thanks to Zeph!) who said they would put me in touch with folks in their department.
  - I made a demo video for one of them.

- **Cofounder search:** I talked to two potential cofounders.  Both are interesting.  Like dating, it’s hard to gauge potential or how fast to move.
- **HIPAA:** Steady progress here. Signed with a company and had our kickoff meeting.
- **Development:** I spent a good deal of the week upgrading the platform to fix an issue and allow for more scaling.  After ODF, I hope to spend some time

## This week

- I mentioned this last week, but I applied to and got into a program called ODF (On Deck Founders). I’m hoping to find a great cofounder there, but either way, it will be good to connect with other founders.  I am likely older than the average by about 15 years and I’m trying not to feel self-conscious about it, but I spent some extra time making sure my middle-aged ear tufts aren’t showing ([great product](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYPWHHNV/ref=dp_iou_view_item?ie=UTF8&th=1), not a vape pen).

## Stock Video of the Week

As I mentioned last week, we can now make videos out of a single image.  As a friend said “It’s not the AI future we wanted, but it’s the one we deserve”.

A few weeks ago, I shared this weird image of a woman giving an apple to a horse

![29ea60e5-6486-2d91-38a8-e7a9a7ad9546.jpg](/assets/images/29ea60e5-6486-2d91-38a8-e7a9a7ad9546.jpg)

and gave it this irresponsible instruction:

_The apple is dropped and the woman and the horse kiss. Then the woman slaps the horse in outrage._

I’m sorry.  I tried this 2x and got two results. Thankfully, in neither instance did the AI allow a depiction of violence.

The first one is very sweet and innocent.

In the second one, she awkwardly tries to make out with the horse. I’m sorry, but I am not including it in this very professional newsletter…

Next time, we’ll tone down the content and introduce talking!

**As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!**
