## I’m getting traction!

Heya,

It’s been 2 weeks and it always feels like too much happens for one email.  So I’m leaving a bunch out.  The biggest news is:

## I have enough validation to focus!

The last time I showed you a value proposition diagram, it had morphed and exploded from one idea (which was not viable) to many new ones to explore and it looked like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/6004bbc2-c127-0496-7a3d-c40400bcd7d2.png" alt="6004bbc2-c127-0496-7a3d-c40400bcd7d2.png">

The black boxes below represent things I had been trying and wasn’t giving up on.  The green were new things to try.

Of these remaining boxes, I’ve had the most traction with clinical researchers in academia (and had the other options either give lukewarm receptions or it’s not a fit).  There is a story behind each one, that I’d be glad to fill you in on if you’re interested.

So here is what it looks like today:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/e5a61d6e-d50f-be6e-6ec4-e9a5c7fd25ae.png" alt="e5a61d6e-d50f-be6e-6ec4-e9a5c7fd25ae.png">

As you can see, it’s much neater! It’s pretty much a sentence.  Traction is allowing me to focus.  It's possible that I’m focusing prematurely, because I haven’t proven this out or gotten paid, but I feel confident _enough_ to focus here until it’s proven wrong.

Within this, there are particular focus areas that need to be figured out.  For instance, there are lots of kinds of interviews that researchers do.  Do we focus on academics first or pharma?

## Things got busy fast!

I went from having a couple pilots that were chugging along (and needing more) to having a bunch of interest, new requirements, and a vision for how this could scale. Suddenly, everything is hitting at once. I’m trying to figure out the highest priorities and do them as quickly as possible. Also, now with traction, it’s time to _start_ talking to VCs and potential cofounders. I’m not confident enough to raise yet, but I heard you should start conversations before then.  As one person, it’s not possible.

There are also so many things to talk about. Things that you don’t think (or shouldn’t think about) until you have identified a problem/solution set. Things like competition, differentiation, business model, etc.

Over the coming weeks, I’ll introduce some of these one at a time.

## I joined ODF

I applied to and got into a pay-to-play program called ODF (On Deck Founders).  I am paying $800 to spend a week in SF with other folks, largely technical, who might be interested in starting a company.  While there is all sorts of programming around raising money, prototyping etc, I am in it for two things:

- It’s pitched as a way to find a cofounder
- You get $10,000 in AWS credits.

  - I just moved most of my stack to AWS. This would pay for the program and give me some nice runway.

It’s February 28th→ March 7th. It will create some challenges re: juggling family.  I cannot believe I used to go to SF every day!

## Follow up about competitor

Last time. I wrote to you about how a competitor was doing senior loneliness for consumers and how it made me second guess my decision.

Well I met them, and spoke to them and it turns out that they provide services to nursing homes and started this as an add-on feature. The nursing homes were kind of “meh” about it so far, because loneliness and patient well-being was not a priority. (which is what I found).

But they also  figured “why not just make a website for consumers”. So far- no traction. So that's how I ended up seeing a copy of my website a couple months after I abandoned the use case. All in all, this is a comforting explanation for seeing this.

## Last Two Weeks

- **Customer Development:**

  - A new researcher who is interested in piloting.  Going to run it by his IRB this week.
  - Other pilots moving forward…slowly. (5 total now)

- **Product Development:**

  - Fixed outbound calling and voicemail detection
  - Moved stack to AWS for HIPAA compliance
  - Got AWS credits $1000.  Going to get more.

- **Joined ODF**
- **HIPAA compliance progress:**

  - Added “privacy and ethics” page to website: https://www.sagevoice.ai/privacy-and-ethics
  - While I got there most of the way myself, there are a few things here (like creating dozen sets of protocols and monitoring) that will take awhile. Now that things are heating up, I think I’m going to pay a firm $2,500/year to do this last piece. It’s a big outlay, but I think it’s a good tradeoff. I shopped around.

    - BTW: Vanta quoted $10-15k, 2 others said $4k was the lowest.

## This week:

- **Get HIPAA sorted:** hire a firm to help
- **Begin building a new diagnostic interview:** Begin work on diagnostic for summer trial. It measures brain health and it requires some new capabilities.
- **Return to the dating scene:** Now that I have a stronger hypothesis, I setup a a few co-founder dates
- Research the market.  If I’m going to find a cofounder or start funding conversations, I need to know things like “how much $ am I saving these labs”, “what is the total size of the opportunity”, etc.

## **Stock Image Video of the week**

Dude.  You can now take a stock image and they’ll use AI to make a video out of it.  It’s really wild. I’m going to start simple.

Here is an image of that guy confidentally giving us the finger.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bc32753d-8284-8e69-a0c0-65f3adb244d5.jpg" alt="bc32753d-8284-8e69-a0c0-65f3adb244d5.jpg">

I gave it this prompt:

_the guys puts his middle finger tipp together and they fuse in the middle.  He is surprised and alarmed._

Here is what they generated:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/4f4c3aef0f25762ab980cef148548e98.png" alt="4f4c3aef0f25762ab980cef148548e98.png">

But you can add music, noise or words.  So I gave it this prompt:

_Make a bell chime when his fingers touch._

(this was after the most obvious, but juvenile sound effect)

Here is what they generated:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/f564b759991435d584bd84b835642be0.png" alt="f564b759991435d584bd84b835642be0.png">

With me so far?  Next week it’s going to get weird.

**As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!**
