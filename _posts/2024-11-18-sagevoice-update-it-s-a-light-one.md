# Keeping it light

👋 Last week’s update was long and not a whole lot of surprises this week, so I’m keeping this light.

### Last week

- **Finished the new landing page.**This page emphasizes how SageVoice can be used to connect with family members.…not tested yet, because I wanted to add something else to improve it’s chances.  Here’s an image from the page…

- **Networking event.** I attended an East Bay Eldercare networking event. Everyone was really nice and I learned a lot. I think it’s a small community and that this might be the way that I get more consistent traction with folks at senior living facilities.
- **Coding.** I did a lot of coding this week to prepare for the pilot. This is partly necessary and partly a motivational reward.

### Next week

- **Pilot presentation.** The first step of the pilot with the senior living facility is a presentation to the residents on Tuesday. I have no idea how many will attend or what will come of it. I could end the week with a bunch of new users, or none.
- **Testing a new path-to-purchase.** I didn’t test the new landing page.  If I’m going to spend money on traffic to test the new landing page, I want to make some other changes. Specifically, walking the user through some questions before getting to the purchase page. I think the idea is that they get a little invested and then a free trial seems more reasonable. That is what Storyworth and some other companies do, so I figure it’s worth throwing in there.
- **Research.** Dig deeper into the academic/pharma use case. I barely touched it this week.
