Howdy!

I hope this finds you in a good mood.

Last week was a short week for me (basically 3 days), but I've been working nights and any free chance I can. I'm feeling a lot of pressure to hit my own pre-determined timelines, but it all feels really positive.

**Key Learning**

The highlight of my week was learning that instead of painstakingly migrating my website from one platform to another, I could affordably hire a freelancer to finish it.

I was complaining to former trench-fellows, Josh and Toby, (who also have a startup in agetech), that I was taking too long migrating my website…and they told me that Fiverr (a freelancing platform) would let me hire someone to do it at an affordable rate. Within 3 hrs, I had someone else on the problem. They should be finished mid-week!

It was a great reminder to outsource what you can, when you can and a perfect example of working smarter not harder. It was also a reminder that talking to the right people has a very high ROI.

**Last week**

* Migrating website from squarespace→webflow (learning webflow and memberstack 🤦‍♂️)

* Wrote a draft "pitch deck"--or introduction to what I'm trying to do (Thanks to Logan and Krishna for their examples)

* I've been working with a recent college graduate, Rowan, who helped by writing call-scheduling functionality.

* Other great conversations with folks with startups in the same space.

**This week**

* Primary goal is to kickoff a marketing test driving traffic to the site, which requires:

  * Finishing website migration

  * Setting up Google Analytics on the new site, a new google ad campaign, along with conversion goals, etc.

  * Finish integrating call-scheduling work.

* I'm also meeting with some VCs later this week (not trying to raise, just having a first meeting), and hoping it will lead to some good insights. Need to make some edits to the pitch deck based on great, timely feedback (Thanks, Bhavin and Andrew W!)

As always, thank you for all the interest, advice and support!
