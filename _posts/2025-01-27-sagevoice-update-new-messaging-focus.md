# New messaging focus

## A bit on goals

I’ll talk about my February goals in more detail next week, but the basic premise is that I need to validate my use cases.  On the one hand, an eye roll is in order. I’ve been doing that since I started.  But in the current round, I’ll call it round 2, I’m feeling more confident.

Why? When I first started, I had a solution in mind and was trying to evolve and validate it through interviews and user testing… Classic “hammer looking for a nail”.  It’s the number one sin in product development, and I knew this at the time, but sometimes you can’t help yourself (and passion is good).

This time, I’m in a better spot in that I had people tell me their problems and I am building solutions for them.

## New website and messaging

You may have noticed that I changed my email address. Indeed I have a new web domain and new web landing page.  Three things:

1. When I was targeting consumers, I did not want “AI” in the name in any visible way, because AI is scary and bad. However, for institutions, there is interest in what AI can do for them and I think there is value in highlighting it.  So the domain shifted from “[SageVoice.pro](https://www.sagevoice.pro/)→ [SageVoice.ai](https://www.sagevoice.ai/).
2. The old landing page was oriented around senior care through conversation.  The new one does not talk about capturing seniors’ memories or keeping them company.  It strictly follows the use cases I am currently validating.
3. The page is more typical of a b2b website.  Very light on details 😆 and it’s not trying to sell you anything.

## Fattening the pipeline

This week, I found myself twiddling my thumbs a little.  Why? I had two research labs ask me to prepare SageVoice versions of their existing interviews/surveys for review. These were the first potential “customers” who expressed enthusiastic interest in something I could build.  So I built them and now I need their feedback. The Columbia one is set for this Thursday.  The Stanford lab set up a demo for Feb 11th.

These demos are essential for gathering feedback and further assessing the viability of this path of serving researchers.

I did some forward looking work, but with just these two interested parties, it doesn’t make sense to build out the prototype any further as it could be wasted work. So I did some more outreach to try and thicken my pipeline. Assuming everyone moves slowly, I should aim to have 4-6 pilots going.

## Last week:

- **Built a new prototype:** at request of a Columbia University lab (mid-study data collection, replacing web surveys with richer data)

  - You can take the survey [here](https://www.sagevoice.ai/demo-form-for-cardiac).  It’s not the clearest survey, but it’s what they’re currently using…
  - It now takes about a half day to add a new survey!

- **Interviews:** 1 “research coordinator”
- **Outreach**: I sent 14 new emails out, 2 phone calls, a dozen follow ups and queued 1 dozen new emails to send early next week.

  - The new dozen, led to one bite: another researcher, doing geriatric depression. We’re talking next week.
  - My amazing sister in law and I started exploring a potential project for her food systems non-profit, which runs a lot of research. Check out her org [here](https://www.foodinsightgroup.com/) (they do incredible work!)
  - I have 4 people who have promised to put me in touch with someone.
  - Skilled Nursing Facilities remain an area where I haven’t talked to anybody!

- **HIPAA research:** I started mapping out steps towards HIPAA compliance in case these research use cases (or medical) take off. No red flags yet.
- **Grunt work:**

  - Fixed a couple things in the app so that single word answers would be captured more accurately
  - Made it so that the app will reschedule with you.

## **This week**

- **Share prototype:** Schedule time for feedback on prototype from Columbia lab 🤞
- **Outreach**: I have a meeting on Friday with a potential research customer, and 28 emails queued to send on Tuesday.  I hope I get some more bites.  I’ll aim for another 12 outbound next week.
- **Build:** Mock up a survey for my sister-in-law’s org.

## **Stock Image of the week**

We’re back to unsettling use of farm animals.  Why? Because people are bad at animals. Using another, live animal as furniture while you canoodle is the ultimate insult. Note: the pig kind of looks dead. That is worse, right?

**As always, questions/feedback/advice on the process or even this email is welcome!**
