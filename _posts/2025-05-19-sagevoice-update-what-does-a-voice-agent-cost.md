Heya Folks,

I’m going to keep this one short.  Busy executing!

## May Goals

1. My top objective for May is to find a new pilot in academia or pharma (see below).
2. My secondary objective is to figure out the path to market for pharmaceutical clinical trials, via  customer discovery in that space–the two are somewhat related.

## What does Voice AI cost and why does it matter?

One obvious question for any business is whether or not you can sell something for less than it costs to produce.  The answer for SageVoice is undoubtedly yes, but it’s not like typical software.

For anyone used to the software industry, you already know that the ‘marginal cost’ of the good itself approaches 0.  For Google calendar, for instance, whether 100 people or 1000 people use it, the cost to Google is pretty much the same. Every new user is almost pure profit.  You can give it away for free, as Google does for consumers, or charge a flat rate like $10/month and know that most of that will be profit.

Compare this to a paper calendar, and the difference is obvious: someone had to grow the tree, cut the tree, make the paper, make the ink, print it, deliver it to the point of sale.  In this case, the marginal cost is a significant portion of what you charge. If you sell it for $10, and it cost $7 to make, you make $3 per user.

Voice AI, currently, is more like a physical good in this regard. Due to the level of computation involved, it requires specialized hardware, new IP, and more energy. The cost of delivering the service is, therefore, measured by the minute. There’s a [recent tweet about this](https://x.com/kwindla/status/1914086659316211982) that Venki shared with me, showing that, on average, the cost per minute is $0.023, or $1.40 an hour. Here’s a link to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-B3nv7fhwEoFmDs-phm280XK9phTep0qfyLKRNsEwVE/edit?gid=0#gid=0).  I think it ends up being more like $3-5 at my scale, particularly if you include hosting and post-processing of calls.

What does this mean for SageVoice?  Well it definitely changes how the solution is offered.  For instance, I can’t say “for $X a month, you get unlimited usage”.  I have to charge per minute or hour, because each minute has a significant cost.  The pilot that dropped out, for instance, would have cost me $10k. If I’m competing with human interviewers, $3 cost structure is great. I can charge ½ of what a human interviewer would cost and be a very attractive solution, while earning profit.  If I’m competing against web surveys, which are free at the margins, then it get’s more complicated—I have to offer a much better experience to justify something that would cost more.

It’s worth noting that the price of AI + Voice should go down over time.  There is a GPU shortage, the current foundational models aren’t as efficient as they could be, and with the market getting more crowded, there is downward pricing pressure on the AI model providers.

## Learnings of the week

Some things I’m learning in interviews about the model

**Challenges**

- **Folks who run clinical trials are conservative with new tech adoption.** As one example, an interviewee at a large pharmaceutical told me they just adopted e-consent, which lets participants sign consent to participate in a study electronically rather than in person.  In other words, docusign was founded in 2003 and 22 years later, it’s prevalent in clinical trials. Another example was an interviewee whose company’s entire role is converting paper forms into electronic ones.
- **More compliance.** In addition to HIPAA compliance, I’m hearing more and more that compliance with [21 CFR part 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_21_CFR_Part_11) (an FDA regulation) is going to be a requirement.  This looks like documenting policies and procedures more than anything.

**Opportunities**

- **There is a desire to replace web surveys**.I had one interviewer tell me that they provide surveys on tablets (like an ipad) and this is a challenge for their older patients, and often requires a visit to the site.  Anything that replaces an in-person visit is incredibly valuable.  Patients are sometimes coming from far away and travel for the sick is a big deal.
- **Regular calls throughout a study.** For long-running oncology studies, patients need to be checked-in-on every 3 months for years to…well..see if they’re still alive.  This is an obvious area where telephone calls by humans are annoying, expensive, and unreliably scheduled.
- **Once you’re in…you’re in!** Once you get past a large company's IT procurement department and are logged as a preferred vendor, you have pretty good adoption. Unclear so far how you get in, but one way is to have a single study request inclusion.

## Last week

- **Market Exploration and Development.**

  - Goal: 10 interviews/leads a week.

    - Generated 2 additional interviews this week. Had a couple more follows up from linkedin (accepting a connection request + note), but didn’t get any to final stage
    - 1 potential lead for a pilot

  - Actions:

    - 4 interviews conducted
    - 30 outreach emails/day and linked in Monday-Thursday

      - I slowed down on this significantly–sent maybe 50 total.

    - 1 LinkedIn post

- **Product development- more diagnostic capabilities**

  - I had another demo scheduled for the primary skeptic at Columbia– the expectation was that we would polish out the rough edges on the diagnostic we showed the previous Friday

    - 90% of my time this week went into this, because I kept doing things that didn’t pan out.  For example, to speed up the LLM requests I swapped from Anthropic to OpenAI, OpenAI proved unreliable, so I swapped back.
    - I did make some progress, but there is more to do.

## This week

- **Market Exploration and Development.**

  - Goal: 10 interviews/leads a week.  (Specifically trying to hone in on folks who sell into the clinical trial space, IT departments or folks who might be interested in trying a pilot.)
  - Outputs:

    - 20 Emails a day, follow ups
    - 1 Linked in message a week
    - Only 2 interviews scheduled this week

- **Product development**

  - After last week’s grind, I want to focus on traction some more, but might dabble here as needed.
  - Columbia’s IT/IRB process has new questions. I’ll look into those.

## Heads up:

Next week is a 3 day week for me, so no update next Monday!

## Media Generation of the Week

We’re back to comics! I decided that a comic about me and Sage, a spunky little toddler of an AI, would be funny to me, so that is what is happening:
