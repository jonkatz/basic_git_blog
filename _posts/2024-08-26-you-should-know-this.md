People are great! A number of thoughtful people reached out to help after my update last week, giving advice, putting me in touch with great people who are either experts in the space, on the same journey, or have relevant experience. I'm so grateful.

**Last week highlights**

1. **Outreach to folks in the adult care space.** While reaching out cold hasn't born fruit yet, I made progress through warm connections to generous industry experts. One reinforced a suspicion I had, which is that generally going from enterprise→ consumer might be the easier approach in agetech. Despite the vast majority of individuals aging in place, the housing and care facilities are better for marketing and selling to.

2. **Exploring accelerators.** If going through institutions is the path (TBD), there are accelerators and communities that help find institutions to pilot with. The deadlines ~end of September. I had lunch with someone last week who got into one of these, and he's going to send a copy of his application so I can see what kind of structure and approach they might be looking for.

3. **Building.** I am also 40% through building a version of the offering that checks in on an older person on a scheduled basis and provides updates, reminders, etc. Once that is built, the goal will be to test it with live people and test various value prop messaging via google ads.

**This week**

- More research/mapping of the eldercare landscape

- Get from 40→80% of the daily check-in prototype done (want to be able to test in 2 weeks)

- Follow up on a number of leads kicked-off last week.

**Is this boring?**

If you're like, "Dude this is boring, keep it shorter/make it longer, tell a story each week instead, tell us about your emotional journey, etc", let me know.

As always, if you have any insights, comments or questions, shoot them my way!
