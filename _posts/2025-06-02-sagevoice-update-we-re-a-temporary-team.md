Hey There!

It’s been two calendar weeks, but we were camping and then moving, so it feels like no time at all has passed.

Here’s a wholesome pic from our campout.

And of the DVDs I just gave to goodwill. Yes, I had and, they still accept, DVDs.

And…I just realized that I donated a 1990’s home video to Goodwill. 🤦‍♂️ (Costco doesn’t make movies, right?) The blanked out one is politically polarizing…but if you email me directly I’ll tell you what it was. I didn’t even watch it!

In light of all the unpacking, I’ll paraphrase some guy and say “I would have written a shorter update, but I didn’t have the time”

Reminder:  
Our value proposition,

**\*We solve** interviewing subjects at scale, **for** clinical researchers, **by** offering structured interviews **using** AI-enabled telephone calls.\*

## 4 people working on SageVoice!

It’s funny how things come in waves, but I went from working solo for most of the year, to now, working with 3 other people SageVoice.  In all cases, we’re feeling it out as we go.

[Abhijit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalamkar/) is a veteran engineer (google + healthcare startups) and has rebuilt our stack in a simpler way on Google Cloud, leveraging more of their built-in capabilities. I’m in the process of migrating the key conversational flows to it. He is splitting his time between this, another medical startup and some consulting.

[Hugo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/h-neves/) has been leading customer success teams in the clinical trials space, most notably at Curebase, which provides software solutions. He is acting as a strategic advisor, helping us with our GTM and is already making introductions to potential customers.

I don’t want to name our potential summer intern yet, since we just started talking, but he’s a CS major at Berkeley and eager to get his hands dirty. We talked last week and he is already in the code!

## 2 Crucial Goals

There are two immediate things that have to go right for this company to thrive.

There are two immediate things that have to go right for this company to thrive.

1. **Our upcoming pilot with Columbia University  is successful**

- Agent quality is good
- Agent is stable
- Reporting is good
- Users react well (somewhat out of our control)
- We get approved by their security-centric IT department.

Status:

- Currently a few known, but solvable issues.  We have till July 1st so it’s 80% of what I’m doing.
- For e), they haven’t gotten back to us.  We don’t know if there are any issues.

1. **We find other people willing to pay for this service**

   - Bring in leads who feel the pain
   - Impress them
   - Get past their IT departments

   Status:

   - Have a few open leads
   - Just brought on an advisor (Hugo) with experience in the clinical trials space who is going to be making introductions
   - Our current dashboard is not sufficient.

## Last 2 weeks

- **Market Exploration and Development.**

  - Goal: 10 interviews/leads a week.
  - Actions/Outcomes:

    - A few more interviews.  Not hitting my goal here.
    - 100s of cold emails hasn’t been great…

      - I think most of it goes into the spam folder.  Thanks to Peter for helping me with my domain reputation.
      - The few responses I have gotten respond and then don’t schedule or provide times they’re available.

    - 1 Linkedin post that got very little traction. Probably my least popular post ever, despite being more thoughtful about strategy. I’m thinking more personal and better images?
    - My Aunt Margy was incredible in that she gave my one pager and an overview to her cardiologist, who works for a clinical trial’s “site network”. They said they’d be in touch.  So great, right?! Thanks, Margy!

- **Product development- more diagnostic capabilities**

  - I got the heads up from our Columbia contact that there is a threat to the pilot if we don’t show that it’s working smoothly soon.  There are a lot of edge cases. It’s an interesting datapoint that in building an MVP in this space there is no room for error-better to have a small, but perfect feature set. Worked on:

    - Latency (much better on Gemini than Anthropic)!
    - Prompts–breaking them up into steps seems to work
    - HD codecs for phone…hit some snags.

## This week

- **Market Exploration and Development.**

  - Goal: More pilots
  - Outputs:

    - With Hugo on board, we’re talking to a few of his connections either this week or soon.  This means we need to put together sales materials.
    - 1 pager for site networks
    - Revised demo deck

  - Also…might apply to an accelerator (start X) if time.

- **Product development**

  - Goal: get to a new, working demo for the Columbia pilot to review

    - Onboarding our intern
    - Finish migrating to Google Cloud
    - Some unexciting stability fixes.

- **Finish unpacking!**

## Media Generation of the Week

More comics!  I took last week’s “Garfield” style of me and my adorable little bot and tried a New Yorker version.
