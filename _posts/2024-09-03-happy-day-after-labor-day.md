I hope you had a great weekend

**Goal snapshot**

Someone asked last week how my weekly goals tie to broader goals. Great question!

Here are my goals:

1. By the end of July 2025, solid market traction or raised money.

2. By mid-October, have applied to the two age-tech accelerators (for expert support, industry insights, connections to potential pilot institutions)

3. To get focus and support an application, learn!

   a. Have folks test new prototype

   b. Run another ad test to get a sense for consumer demand (which product/messages appeal) starting mid September.

   c. Work on institutional inroads towards a pilot (this is a little bit on the backburner while I focus on #2).

With three weeks to go before the first accelerator deadline, I'd like to have some sense of market demand. So I am mostly focused on wrapping this second version of the product and running a solid test of interest and messaging.

**Last Week**

* I finished an MVP (minimum viable product) of a daily check-in/monitoring product. It calls the senior every day and offers a joke/shares positive news, but then checks in on them. "You mentioned you were going to call your friend Cindy last night, how did that go"? It sends a report to the person who bought it.

  * Note: There's a lot of understandable interest in using AI to connect, rather than augment caregivers. So an interesting idea would be to tweak this to be an equivalent to the "photostream", wherein it gets sent to a number of people in their network to create potential touchpoints. "Hey Uncle Dave, I heard you watched the US Open…."

* Really helpful conversations with experts, including someone who worked on Amazon's Alexa product for seniors.

* In the interest of driving traffic and getting solid data, I started researching porting my site from a web site Squarespace to Webflow. Squarespace is really set-up more for basic landing pages, or selling hats and doesn't have great support for a digital service like this.

**This Week**

* Mostly preparing to run a google ads test with 2 versions of the product and different messaging to see what resonates

  * Wrap up the MVP and ensure scheduling works.

  * Port the site to Webflow (if that's what needs to happen).

* Starting thinking about a pitch deck.

As always, if you have any insights, comments or questions, shoot them my way!
