# First off, it’s spring break!!

Kids are off school, so I’m out this week. No big plans, just Dadding-it-up around town.

My 7 year old’s big ambition is eating Jell-O.  We will definitely do that. I wrote this Sunday so that I could be JellO-drunk all week.

No newsletter next week.

## “We plan, God laughs.”

I mapped out what I see as the theoretical path to greatness.  As I mentioned last week, my week plans change daily. Will this plan change? Yes.

Like all future planning, it is a work of speculative fiction, but like all plans, it’s valuable as a strategy and communication tool.  You might have to click on these images to read them (sorry).

**Stage 1** was proving that I found a valid-sounding solution to a real problem ✅

**Stage 2** is proving it works (the IF statement here)

**Stage 3** is demonstrating economics and market size (can we get paid and pharma)

**Stage 4** is scaling (can we go beyond the first customers)

## Mental health update

I try to be honest about how things are going in my brain.  I mentioned in the last email that I was reprioritizing constantly.  Well, that hit a fever pitch last week.  It totally sucked.  You know when you’re sleeping and your mind is racing and you have fever dreams in which you’re stressed out? (really hoping that’s not just me)

Okay, well I was doing that while awake, but with a startup. Everything seemed urgent, I kept switching what I was doing, feeling guilty, and generally stressed that I should be doing something else.  Made progress, but was not in a good head space for a couple days.

Feeling better now.  Friday I had a customer call and came out of it with a renewed sense of purpose and direction.

## Last week

- **Customer Development**

  - Met with the Dean of Public Health at UC Berkeley. He seemed really impressed and was positive about it. His Director of Research Development couldn’t make the call and he kept saying what a shame it was that she wasn’t there.  So I’m meeting with her next Monday.  The explicit purpose is to get feedback from her and see if she knows if any of their **200** current studies would benefit!
  - Set up concrete plan for Dementia Prevention study in Southern California (first patients onboarding in April)
  - Drafted MOUs for 2 pilot partners (basically have them say “we would pay for this if pilot works”)

- **Product Development:**

  - **Lots of product testing.**This is where my brain got a little nuts–AI is non-deterministic, meaning that an error might appear 2% of the time.  So it’s hard to find an error and know that you fixed it.  Especially if that error is “the LLM API call took 3 seconds instead of 1”.
  - **Lots of infrastructure.** I put up a staging server and found a way to get access to my now, very private, HIPAA compliant database.  This is where my brain got very nuts.

- **HIPAA**

  - Pretty much there. Just have to push the data to a HIPAA compliant Google Drive rather than use email.

## This week

- Vacation

## Next week

- **Customer Development**

  - Meetings with Berkeley Public Health’s head of research development and Stanford Medicine’s research technology leads. (These represent calendar months worth of making connections).
  - Hoping to make progress on MOU development.

- **Product Development:**

  - Creating an automated, secure way to get the data from my app to my clients.  Right now it’s stored in folders specific to each end-user, which does not scale.
  - More automated testing.

- **HIPAA/Privacy**

  - Some minor cleanup. I think I’ll declare HIPAA compliance in Mid April.
  - I’m hoping to hear back on what is required from Columbia’s IRB (internal review board that requires certain privacy/security measures are taken by all vendors).

## Stock photo of the week Media Generation of the Week

This section is rapidly evolving…I started just being amazed by stock photo libraries (and the business of stock photograph).  In the last few weeks, I showed how you can turn photos into videos, and, last week, change the race of the people involved.  I am so impressed that these companies aren’t letting AI destroy their business, but went all in: using it to provide very compelling new offerings.

Last week’s, OpenAI released a new image generation offering that further threatens the legacy business of stock photography.  It provides very very good imagery without having to search a library. You can see some great examples on the internet.

The inevitable, but scary thing is that they took many of the guardrails off around editing existing people or famous people.

Last time I showed you a guy getting a present:

and how you could change the race of the men.

With ChatGPT’s new offering, I could take the same original image and replace the old man with Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez:

And it didn’t stop me from replacing Putin with her. Now…I told it not to change the position or the clothes, which is why it looks a little unnatural, but it’s pretty good for a single shot prompt.

Strange days.
